This github was created to document the work gage did during his Quantum Algorithms Optimizing Research Experience for undergraduates. It was made briefly and was never made initially to be viewed by otherpeople. I urge you to read the jupyter notebooks and understand what is happening. To begin first start with QAO_REU_NN_Accuracies.pdf it will give a brief overview of the models and their accuracies.
